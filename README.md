## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the backend repository to your local machine.

git clone <backend-repo-url>

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.

cd backend
npm install

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend and define the necessary environment variables. These variables typically include database connection details, JWT secret, etc.
   DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

4. **Start the Server**: Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, start the backend server by running the following command:
   npm start

5. **Accessing API Endpoints**: Your backend server should now be running and accessible at the specified port (default is 5000). You can access the defined API endpoints by making HTTP requests to the appropriate routes.

## Additional Information

- **Database Configuration**: Update the database connection string in the `.env` file to connect to your preferred database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

- **Authentication**: The backend includes authentication middleware (`authMiddleware.js`) and authentication routes (`authRoutes.js`). Customize these according to your authentication requirements.

- **Route Handlers**: Define route handlers in the `controllers` directory to handle incoming requests and interact with the database.
